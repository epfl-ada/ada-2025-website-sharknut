To investigate Alzheimer’s disease across cellular, molecular, and spatial dimensions, we rely on spatial transcriptomics, a technology that measures gene expression directly in intact tissue while preserving spatial context. This approach makes it possible to identify cell types, quantify their transcriptional states, and examine how cells are organized relative to one another, all within the same tissue section.

*Figure 3 : **Overview of spatial transcriptomics datasets analyzed in this study.**
One wild-type mouse (13.4 months), one TgCRND8 mouse (17.9 months), one human Alzheimer’s disease sample, and one healthy human control were profiled using the Xenium In Situ gene expression platform. All analyses focus on cortical tissue.*
  
For the mouse data, we focus on the TgCRND8 model of Alzheimer’s disease, a widely used transgenic model carrying human APP with the Swedish (KM670/671NL) and Indiana (V717F) mutations. These mutations drive early and robust amyloid pathology, making TgCRND8 a popular model for studying amyloid-related mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease. One TgCRND8 mouse (17.9 months) was compared to one wild-type control (13.4 months).

Human data consist of post-mortem cortical tissue sections from one individual diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and one neurologically healthy control, obtained from the Human Xenium Brain dataset provided by 10x Genomics. While limited in sample number, these data provide high-resolution spatial transcriptomic measurements that enable a detailed comparison of disease-associated cellular, molecular, and spatial features within human cortex.

Both mouse and human samples were generated using the Xenium In Situ gene expression platform, which profiles a targeted panel of genes selected to capture major cell types and disease-relevant biological pathways. Using the same spatial transcriptomics technology across species ensures comparable data structure, quality metrics, and spatial resolution, forming a solid foundation for meaningful cross-species comparison.
