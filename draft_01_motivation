## 1. Why model relevance matters in Alzheimer’s disease
<a id="why-models"></a>
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes that ultimately impair daily life. Today, tens of millions of people live with the disease, and this number is expected to rise sharply as populations age. Beyond the personal and emotional toll on patients and families, Alzheimer’s represents a growing public health challenge, with enormous social and economic consequences. Yet despite decades of research, there is still no cure, and disease-modifying treatments remain limited.

At the biological level, Alzheimer’s disease is not the result of a single malfunction. Although amyloid plaques and tau tangles are its most recognizable features, the disease unfolds through widespread changes in the brain’s cellular ecosystem. Neurons, glial cells, and immune cells do not simply degenerate or activate in isolation: their abundance shifts, their molecular programs are altered, and their spatial relationships within tissue are reorganized. Together, these changes shape how the disease emerges, propagates, and ultimately disrupts brain function.

Because access to living human brain tissue is inherently limited, much of our understanding of these processes comes from animal models. Over the years, a wide range of mouse models has been developed to study Alzheimer’s disease, each designed to capture specific aspects of pathology, such as amyloid accumulation, tau-related changes, or neuroinflammatory responses. Mouse models such as TgCRND8 have been instrumental in dissecting amyloid-driven mechanisms and testing therapeutic hypotheses. At the same time, mouse and human brains differ in key ways, such as their cellular composition, transcriptional regulation, and tissue organization, meaning that not all disease features observed in mice translate directly to human patients.

This diversity of models highlights an important point: Alzheimer’s disease cannot be reduced to a single biological readout, and no model is expected to reproduce all of its facets simultaneously. Rather than treating model validity as an all-or-nothing concept, a more informative question is which dimensions of the disease a given model captures, and which it does not. In this project, we adopt this perspective by comparing TgCRND8 mouse and human Alzheimer’s brain across three complementary scales: cellular composition and activation, transcriptional programs within cell types, and local spatial organization, using spatial transcriptomics to identify both points of convergence and sources of divergence.

Alzheimer’s disease affects the brain across multiple biological scales, from cellular composition to gene regulation and spatial organization. We assess the relevance of the TgCRND8 mouse model by comparing mouse and human Alzheimer’s brains independently at each of these scales.*
