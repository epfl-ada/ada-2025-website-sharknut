Direct comparison between mouse and human spatial transcriptomics data is not straightforward. Beyond biological differences, the datasets differ in anatomical coverage, cell-type annotation strategies, and data structure. Meaningful cross-species analysis therefore requires careful preprocessing and harmonization to ensure that observed differences reflect disease- and species-related effects rather than technical or anatomical mismatches.
