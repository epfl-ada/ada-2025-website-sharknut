# Research Question 2 — Transcriptional programs within cell types
<a id="rq2"></a>

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with widespread transcriptional changes in the brain, but the extent to which these changes are conserved across species remains unclear. In this research question, we ask whether within corresponding cell types, TgCRND8 mice and human Alzheimer’s brains exhibit similar disease-associated transcriptional programs. Rather than focusing solely on gene-by-gene overlap, which is known to be limited between mouse and human, we examine transcriptional changes within matched broad cell classes and assess convergence at both the gene and pathway levels.

## 5. Disease-related transcriptional changes differ strongly by species

Across all cell classes, human Alzheimer’s samples exhibit substantially more differentially expressed genes than TgCRND8 mice. This asymmetry is consistent across neuronal and glial populations, indicating that transcriptional remodeling in human disease is both broader and more pronounced than in the mouse model.
Importantly, this difference is not uniform across cell types. Some populations, such as oligodendrocyte–OPC lineage cells, show particularly limited transcriptional changes in mouse compared to human, highlighting strong cell-type-specific differences in disease impact.
