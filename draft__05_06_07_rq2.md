# Research Question 2 — Transcriptional programs within cell types
<a id="rq2"></a>

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with widespread transcriptional changes in the brain, but the extent to which these changes are conserved across species remains unclear. In this research question, we ask whether within corresponding cell types, TgCRND8 mice and human Alzheimer’s brains exhibit similar disease-associated transcriptional programs. Rather than focusing solely on gene-by-gene overlap, which is known to be limited between mouse and human, we examine transcriptional changes within matched broad cell classes and assess convergence at both the gene and pathway levels.

## 5. Disease-related transcriptional changes differ strongly by species

Across all cell classes, human Alzheimer’s samples exhibit substantially more differentially expressed genes than TgCRND8 mice. This asymmetry is consistent across neuronal and glial populations, indicating that transcriptional remodeling in human disease is both broader and more pronounced than in the mouse model.
Importantly, this difference is not uniform across cell types. Some populations, such as oligodendrocyte–OPC lineage cells, show particularly limited transcriptional changes in mouse compared to human, highlighting strong cell-type-specific differences in disease impact.

## 6. From genes to pathways: assessing biological convergence

The strong imbalance in gene-level differential expression between mouse and human Alzheimer’s samples makes direct gene-by-gene comparison challenging. In many cell classes, human Alzheimer’s samples yield substantially more differentially expressed genes than TgCRND8 mice, resulting in limited raw overlap between species. As a consequence, gene-level concordance alone provides an incomplete view of cross-species similarity.

To address this, we shifted the analysis to the pathway level, where transcriptional changes are interpreted in terms of coordinated biological programs rather than individual genes. For each broad cell class, pathway enrichment analyses were performed independently in mouse and human, using species-specific sets of differentially expressed genes. This design allows comparison of disease-associated functional programs while accounting for the asymmetry in gene-level signal between species.

When examined at this level, clearer patterns of convergence emerge. Within several cell classes, mouse and human Alzheimer’s samples exhibit enrichment of overlapping pathways, even when the underlying gene sets differ substantially. These shared pathways frequently involve immune and inflammatory responses, cellular stress and signaling processes, and metabolic or homeostatic functions, indicating that Alzheimer’s disease can perturb similar biological processes across species despite species-specific transcriptional implementations.

However, pathway-level convergence is neither uniform nor global. The number of enriched pathways, their statistical strength, and their direction of regulation differ markedly between mouse and human, and these differences vary across cell classes. In some cases, pathways enriched in human Alzheimer’s samples have no counterpart in the mouse model, while in others, overlap is observed but with weaker or opposite directional signals.

Overall, this analysis shows that pathway-level comparison reveals partial, cell-type-specific convergence of transcriptional programs between TgCRND8 mice and human Alzheimer’s brains. While pathway analysis recovers shared functional themes that are obscured at the gene level, it also highlights substantial divergence in the scope and magnitude of transcriptional remodeling across species.
